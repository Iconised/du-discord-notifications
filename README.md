# du-discord-notifications
Python script to monitor Dual Universe logs for radar contacts and post them to Discord using a webhook. Credits to Deadrank for writing the base code!

## Note
There is a high chance this no longer works after NQ updated the log format and the log location.

## Instructions for use
1. Create a Discord Bot
2. Get the Discord Bot Auth Token
3. Create a channel to post the messages to
4. Update the .py script to include the token, channel id and set a memorable location
5. Run the script, turn on a radar and see if it posts them to Discord!

## The Outcome

## Credits
Deadrank for writing the script and for sharing many memories of hunting haulers out of Jago.
